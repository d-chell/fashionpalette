The Concept Wardrobe suggests that 'you are a True Autumn if the dominant characteristic of your overall appearance is warm, and the secondary characteristic is muted'. True autumn is a difficult palette to describe, because there are a variety of hair, skin, and eye colors that could combine to form it. Whether or not you are paler or darker, you will likely be a true autumn if your veins are more green than blue, or if compared to similar skin tones, you seem more 'warm'. The most common eye color for true autumns is golden brown, and hazel, but could also be teal. "
